On the 26th of January 1950, India became an independent democratic republic. We are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics, we will have equality, but in social and economic life, we will have inequality. How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life?

If we continue to deny it for long, we will put our political democracy in peril. We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment, or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy.

Another thing we must guard against is hero-worship. Bhakti in religion may be a road to salvation, but in politics, hero-worship is a sure road to dictatorship. Democracy requires that we hold fast to constitutional methods and not rely on extra-constitutional means.

We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. Social democracy means a way of life that recognizes liberty, equality, and fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Without fraternity, liberty and equality would not become a natural course of things.

Democracy is not merely a form of government. It is primarily a mode of associated living, a way of life that recognizes the dignity of every human being.
